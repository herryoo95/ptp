- orignal ptp with cylinder tested to compare Fz using position lookup.
  . result: Fz_comp_cylinder_new_old.fig  (\yoo\temp); ptp_cylinder_20150127_orig.mat , ptpcylinder_20150127_proved.mat) 
  . Fz using position (pressure lookup using position) > Fz using particle
  . Fz suing position is correct (it has been compared with exp. data in paper)

- shearCellForce add
- made calcForce code something clean (unnecessary things deleted)
- for test simulation with virtual position behavior
  . option 'k' used for lateral test simulation.
  . option 'j' used for virtual test simulation.
- for test simulation with real position behavior from real experiment

----20150309------
- compile method changed :  make  --> cmake ./  after that,   make
- Eigen library added to use Vector and other math tools
- axis changed : top on Y axis  >> top on Z axis
- some variables and functions which are not used cleaned 


----20150310------
- source code from ptp_20150309
- ptpSoil mars plugin setup for ptp done
  . for source coding: mars_dev/simulation/mars/plugin/ptpSoil
  . for running : mars_dev/install/configuration/myTest
- osg used
- 3D mouse used  
- configSim(); : config options for foot test behaviors
  . Value = 1  :  vertical exp.
  . Value = 2  :  lateral exp.
- file access for logging commented out  

----20150414------
- extended to six feet
- deleted some codes that are unnecessary (have to check that's correct!)

----20150603 -----
- dynamic soil surface
- every foot has a ptpwork() and a calForce()

----20150605------
<behavior learning framework>
- info--> file:///home/dfki.uni-bremen.de/yoo/development/learning/bootstrap/doc/html/examples/spaceclimber_bg.html

- the goal of this work is to make seperated soil instances
- venD Foot --> Vecotr vFoot
- initializePTP  -->  Vector type input
- PTP* ptp --> PTP ptp
- "configSim" in PtpSoil class has been deleted
- ptpSys  -->  soil
- soil  -->  soil[6]
- num,start,end  --> num[6], start[6], end[6]
- result: 
  . when PtpSoil plugin runs, it just shows the six seperated soil surfaces
  . next work should be done in sim (MARE Core)
  . if collision with Heightmap, then build soil surface on the foot 

- source code is saved to ptpSoil_20150605  


-----20150702---
- Dynamic soil generation done
- to run this version correctly, you should consider the paramters:
  . THRESHOLD : -0.04
  . height of the foot step in the simulation : 0.15
  
-----20150716----
- low pass filter added into WorldPhysics  
- the problem of strange footprints solved:
  . don't use #define USE_MOVEMENT_FUNCTION, because there are some error with particleMovement(&pp->loc,lastFoot)
  . instead of the part of USE MOVEMENT_FUNCTION, we use length between pp position and radius of foot


-----20150722----
- slope surface implemented
  . height of heightfield calculated
  . heigher particles than heightmap top have been moved to the position of top of heightmap 
- footprint code from virtual crater project has been added to soilNode plugin
